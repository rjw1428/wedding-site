            I got on the train in Philadelphia early in the morning to head to work in New York City. I always try to get on the train as fast as I can so I can snag a window seat with an outlet and get some work done on the way. I sat down like normal and got to work…. A few minutes later a guy comes and sits in the seat next to me - I like my space so I’m a little annoyed but the train is crowded so I understand. He asks to use the outlet since his laptop is dead and he leans over me to plug it in. I look up at him for the first time and see how good looking he is and all of a sudden my annoyance disappears. He started talking to me and was a surprisingly good conversationalist too. We talked the whole train ride until we get to his stop in Newark, where he asked me for my number. He was smart, cute, had interesting hobbies, and seemed close with his family - I was interested enough to give him my number and get to know him better. Over the next couple weeks we kept trying to get together in Philly and timing just did not workout. Finally right before he left for a trip to San Diego, he asked me out for coffee.
